# ING Loan Service Take-Home Task

Loan Request Data Structure
unique identifier
amount of the loan which must be between 500 and 12000.50 
customer full name
customer id (unique for each customer)
All of this data is required to create a loan request.

Business Requirements for Loan Request Service:
Create a loan request. The service wonâ€™t receive many of these requests.
Calculate how much money a given customer identified by customer id has applied for, i.e. if a customer has applied for three loans with amounts 1000, 2000 and 3000.25 then this operation should return 6000.25. The service will receive many of these requests.

The Service We Would Like You To Implement
A web service that provides the operations mentioned above.
The operations should be provided via a REST API.
The service should be able to run locally. 

Please provide the instructions in a README.md Please provide the solution in a single self-sufficient zip file to us.
